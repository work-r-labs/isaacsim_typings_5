    The Carbonite Settings interface
    
    Carbonite settings are built on top of the carb.dictionary interface (which is also required in order to use this
    interface). Many dictionary functions are replicated in settings, but explicitly use the settings database instead of a
    generic carb.dictionary.Item object.
    
    carb.settings uses keys (or paths) that start with an optional forward-slash and are forward-slash separated (example:
    "/log/level"). The settings database exists as a root-level carb.dictionary.Item (of type ItemType.DICTIONARY) that is
    created and maintained by the carb.settings system (typically through the carb.settings.plugin plugin). The root level
    settings carb.dictionary.Item is accessible through get_settings_dictionary().
    
    Portions of the settings database hierarchy can be subscribed to with subscribe_to_tree_change_events() or individual
    keys may be subscribed to with subscribe_to_tree_change_events().
