    """
    A utility class for viewing a subset of the joints in a robot Articulation object.
    
        This class can be helpful in two ways:
    
        1) The order of joints returned by a robot Articulation may not match the order of joints
           expected by a function
    
        2) A function may only care about a subset of the joint states that are returned by a robot
           Articulation.
    
        Example:
    
            Suppose the robot Articulation returns positions [0,1,2] for joints ["A","B","C"], and
            suppose that we pass joint_names = ["B","A"].
