    High level wrapper to deal with a Geom prim (only one geometry prim) and its attributes/properties.
    
        The ``prim_path`` should correspond to type UsdGeom.Cube, UsdGeom.Capsule, UsdGeom.Cone, UsdGeom.Cylinder,
        UsdGeom.Sphere or UsdGeom.Mesh.
    
        .. warning::
    
            The geometry object must be initialized in order to be able to operate on it.
            See the ``initialize`` method for more details.
    
        .. warning::
    
            Some methods require the prim to have the Physx Collision API. Instantiate the class with the ``collision``
            parameter to True to apply the collision API.
    
        Args:
            prim_path (str): prim path of the Prim to encapsulate or create.

                                                            (with respect to its parent prim). shape is (3, ).

                                                            (depends if translation or position is specified).

            track_contact_forces (bool, Optional) : if enabled, the view will track the net contact forces on each geometry prim in the view.
                                                    Note that the collision flag should be set to True to report contact forces. Defaults to False.
