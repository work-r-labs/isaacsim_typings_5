                                 Setting this to True will make copies of the source prim when creating new clones; changes to the source prim will not be reflected in clones. Defaults to False. Note that setting this to True will take longer to execute.
                    enable_env_ids (bool): Setting this enables co-location of clones in physics with automatic filtering of collisions between clones.
