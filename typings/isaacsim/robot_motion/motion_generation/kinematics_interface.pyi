    An limitted interface for computing robot kinematics that includes forward and inverse kinematics.
        This interface ommits more advanced kinematics such as Jacobians, as they are not required for most use-cases.
    
        This interface inherits from the WorldInterface to standardize the inputs to collision-aware IK solvers, but it is not necessary for
        all implementations to implement the WorldInterface.  See KinematicsSolver.supports_collision_avoidance()
