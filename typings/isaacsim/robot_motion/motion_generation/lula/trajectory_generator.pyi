        Set solver parameters for the cspace trajectory generator.  A complete list of
                parameters is provided in this docstring.
        
                'max_segment_iterations': (int)
                    In general, a trajectory is locally time-optimal if at least one derivative for one of the
                    c-space coordinates is fully saturated, with no derivative limits for any of the c-space
                    coordinates exceeded.
        
                    This time-optimality can be enforced for each `CubicSpline` segment or for each
                    `PiecewiseCubicSpline` as a whole. The former will, in general, generate trajectories with
                    smaller spans, but will require more expensive iterations (and thus more time) to converge.
                    The latter will, in general, require less iterations (and thus less time) to converge, but
                    the generated trajectories will tend to have longer spans.
        
                    When attempting to find a time-optimal trajectory, the (more expensive) per-segment method
                    will first be attempted for `max_per_segment_iterations`. Then, if not yet converged, the
                    method acting on the entire spline will be attempted for `max_aggregate_iterations`.
        
                    To maximize speed, `max_segment_iterations` should be relatively low (or even zero to remove
                    this search completely). To maximize time-optimality of the generated trajectory,
                    `max_segment_iterations` should be relatively high.
        
                    The sum of `max_segment_iterations` and `max_aggregate_iterations` must be at least 1
        
                'max_aggragate_iterations': (int)
                    See max_segment_iterations
        
                'convergence_dt': (float)
                    The search for optimal time values will terminate if the maximum change to any time value
                    during a given iteration is less than the `convergence_dt`.
        
                    `convergence_dt` must be positive.
        
                'max_dilation_iterations': (int)
                    After the segment-wise and/or aggregate time-optimal search has converged or reached maximum
                    iterations, the resulting set of splines will be tested to see if any derivative limits are
                    exceeded.
        
                    If any derivative limits are exceeded, the splines will be iteratively scaled in time to
                    reduce the maximum achieved derivative. This process will repeat until no derivative limits
                    are exceeded (success) or `max_dilation_iterations_` are reached (failure).
                    For a well-tuned set of solver parameters, very few dilation steps should be required
                    (often none will be required or a single iteration is sufficient to bring a slightly
                    over-saturated trajectory within the derivative limits).
        
                'dilation_dt': (float)
                    For the iterative dilation step described in `setMaxDilationIterations()` documentation, the
                    `dilation_dt` is the "epsilon" value added to the span of the trajectory that exceeds
                    derivative limits.
        
                    `dilation_dt` must be positive.
        
                'min_time_span': (float)
                    Specify the minimum allowable time span between adjacent waypoints/endpoints.
                    `min_time_span` must be positive.
        
                    This is most likely to affect the time span between the endpoints and "free-position" points
                    that are used to enable acceleration bound constraints. If no jerk limit is provided, these free-position points may
                    tend to become arbitrarily close in position and time to the endpoints. This `min_time_span`
                    prevents this time span from approaching zero.
        
                    In general, a jerk limit is recommended for preventing abrupt changes in acceleration rather
                    than relying on the `min_time_span` for this purpose.
        
                'time_split_method': (string)
                    Often waypoints for a trajectory may specify positions without providing time values for when
                    these waypoint position should be attained. In this case, we can use the distance between
                    waypoints to assign time values for each waypoint.
        
                    Assuming a unitary time domain s.t. t_0 = 0 and t_N = 1, we can assign the intermediate time
                    values according to:
        
                      t_k = t_(k-1) + (d_k / d),
        
                    where d = sum(d_k) for k = [0, N-1] and N is the number of points.
        
                    Many options exist for the computing the distance metric d_k, with common options described
                    below (and implemented in `ComputeTimeValues()`.
                    See Eqn 4.37 in "Trajectory Planning for Automatic Machines and Robots" (2008) by
                    Biagiotti & Melchiorri for more detailed motivations.
                    Valid distribution choices are given below:
        
                    'uniform':
                        For a "uniform distribution" w.r.t time, the positions are ignored and d_k can simply be
                        computed as:
        
                          d_k = 1 / (N - 1)
        
                        resulting in uniform time intervals between all points.
        
                    'chord_length':
                        For a "chord length distribution", the time intervals between waypoints are proportional to
                        the Euclidean distance between waypoints:
        
                          d_k = \\|q_(k+1) - q_k\\|
        
                        where q represents the position of the waypoint.
        
                    'centripetal':
                        For a "centripetal distribution", the time intervals between waypoints are proportional to the
                        square root of the Euclidean distance between waypoints:
        
                          d_k = \\|q_(k+1) - q_k\\|^(1/2)

        """
        Set solver parameters for the cspace trajectory generator.  A complete list of
                parameters is provided in this docstring.
        
                'max_segment_iterations': (int)
                    In general, a trajectory is locally time-optimal if at least one derivative for one of the
                    c-space coordinates is fully saturated, with no derivative limits for any of the c-space
                    coordinates exceeded.
        
                    This time-optimality can be enforced for each `CubicSpline` segment or for each
                    `PiecewiseCubicSpline` as a whole. The former will, in general, generate trajectories with
                    smaller spans, but will require more expensive iterations (and thus more time) to converge.
                    The latter will, in general, require less iterations (and thus less time) to converge, but
                    the generated trajectories will tend to have longer spans.
        
                    When attempting to find a time-optimal trajectory, the (more expensive) per-segment method
                    will first be attempted for `max_per_segment_iterations`. Then, if not yet converged, the
                    method acting on the entire spline will be attempted for `max_aggregate_iterations`.
        
                    To maximize speed, `max_segment_iterations` should be relatively low (or even zero to remove
                    this search completely). To maximize time-optimality of the generated trajectory,
                    `max_segment_iterations` should be relatively high.
        
                    The sum of `max_segment_iterations` and `max_aggregate_iterations` must be at least 1
        
                'max_aggragate_iterations': (int)
                    See max_segment_iterations
        
                'convergence_dt': (float)
                    The search for optimal time values will terminate if the maximum change to any time value
                    during a given iteration is less than the `convergence_dt`.
        
                    `convergence_dt` must be positive.
        
                'max_dilation_iterations': (int)
                    After the segment-wise and/or aggregate time-optimal search has converged or reached maximum
                    iterations, the resulting set of splines will be tested to see if any derivative limits are
                    exceeded.
        
                    If any derivative limits are exceeded, the splines will be iteratively scaled in time to
                    reduce the maximum achieved derivative. This process will repeat until no derivative limits
                    are exceeded (success) or `max_dilation_iterations_` are reached (failure).
                    For a well-tuned set of solver parameters, very few dilation steps should be required
                    (often none will be required or a single iteration is sufficient to bring a slightly
                    over-saturated trajectory within the derivative limits).
        
                'dilation_dt': (float)
                    For the iterative dilation step described in `setMaxDilationIterations()` documentation, the
                    `dilation_dt` is the "epsilon" value added to the span of the trajectory that exceeds
                    derivative limits.
        
                    `dilation_dt` must be positive.
        
                'min_time_span': (float)
                    Specify the minimum allowable time span between adjacent waypoints/endpoints.
                    `min_time_span` must be positive.
        
                    This is most likely to affect the time span between the endpoints and "free-position" points
                    that are used to enable acceleration bound constraints. If no jerk limit is provided, these free-position points may
                    tend to become arbitrarily close in position and time to the endpoints. This `min_time_span`
                    prevents this time span from approaching zero.
        
                    In general, a jerk limit is recommended for preventing abrupt changes in acceleration rather
                    than relying on the `min_time_span` for this purpose.
        
                'time_split_method': (string)
                    Often waypoints for a trajectory may specify positions without providing time values for when
                    these waypoint position should be attained. In this case, we can use the distance between
                    waypoints to assign time values for each waypoint.
        
                    Assuming a unitary time domain s.t. t_0 = 0 and t_N = 1, we can assign the intermediate time
                    values according to:
        
                      t_k = t_(k-1) + (d_k / d),
        
                    where d = sum(d_k) for k = [0, N-1] and N is the number of points.
        
                    Many options exist for the computing the distance metric d_k, with common options described
                    below (and implemented in `ComputeTimeValues()`.
                    See Eqn 4.37 in "Trajectory Planning for Automatic Machines and Robots" (2008) by
                    Biagiotti & Melchiorri for more detailed motivations.
                    Valid distribution choices are given below:
        
                    'uniform':
                        For a "uniform distribution" w.r.t time, the positions are ignored and d_k can simply be
                        computed as:
        
                          d_k = 1 / (N - 1)
        
                        resulting in uniform time intervals between all points.
        
                    'chord_length':
                        For a "chord length distribution", the time intervals between waypoints are proportional to
                        the Euclidean distance between waypoints:
        
                          d_k = \\|q_(k+1) - q_k\\|
        
                        where q represents the position of the waypoint.
        
                    'centripetal':
                        For a "centripetal distribution", the time intervals between waypoints are proportional to the
                        square root of the Euclidean distance between waypoints:
        
                          d_k = \\|q_(k+1) - q_k\\|^(1/2)
        
                        where q represents the position of the waypoint.
