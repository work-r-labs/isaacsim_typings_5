    A helper class for quickly visualizing the plans output by a PathPlanner.

        ArticulationActions that may be directly sent to the robot Articulation in order to visualize the planned path.
    
        Args:
            robot_articulation (SingleArticulation): An Articulation object describing a single simulated robot.
            path_planner (PathPlanner):  A PathPlanner object that has been configured to compute plans for the robot
                represented by the robot Articulation.
