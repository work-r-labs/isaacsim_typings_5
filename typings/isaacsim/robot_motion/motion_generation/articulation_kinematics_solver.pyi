    """
    Wrapper class for computing robot kinematics in a way that is easily transferable to the simulated robot Articulation.  A KinematicsSolver
        computes FK and IK at any frame, possibly only using a subset of joints available on the simulated robot.
        This wrapper simplifies computing the current position of the simulated robot's end effector, as well as wrapping an IK result in an ArticulationAction that is
        recognized by the robot Articulation
    
        Args:
            robot_articulation (SingleArticulation): Initialized robot Articulation object representing the simulated USD robot
            kinematics_solver (KinematicsSolver): An instance of a class that implements the KinematicsSolver
            end_effector_frame_name (str): The name of the robot's end effector frame.  This frame must appear in kinematics_solver.get_all_frame_names()
