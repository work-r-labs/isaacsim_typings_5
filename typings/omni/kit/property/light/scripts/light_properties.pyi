    A class that extends the Omniverse Kit by registering a custom widget for light properties.
    
        This class is an extension for the Omniverse Kit, designed to enhance the user interface by adding a custom widget that allows for easy manipulation of light properties in a 3D scene. It leverages USD and UsdLux for defining and managing these properties. Upon startup, the class registers the widget and sets up a path for test data. On shutdown, it ensures the widget is properly unregistered.
    
        It is important to note that the visibility of this widget is contingent on the presence of the property window within the Omniverse Kit. The widget is specifically tailored for light primitives and includes a comprehensive set of light attributes for various light types supported by UsdLux. The class also handles version-specific features of USD, ensuring compatibility across different versions of the software.
