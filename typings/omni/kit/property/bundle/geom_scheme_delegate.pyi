    A delegate class that provides widget building schemes for geometric primitives in a property window.
    
        This class extends the PropertySchemeDelegate and overrides methods to determine the appropriate widgets to display or hide, based on the type of USD geometric primitives encountered. The widget construction is primarily guided by the type of the USD primitive provided in the payload, such as UsdGeom.Mesh, UsdGeom.Camera, or UsdLux.Light among others. It caters to both the inclusion of relevant widgets and the exclusion of irrelevant or unwanted widgets for a given primitive.
