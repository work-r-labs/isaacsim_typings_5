    A class for registering and managing property widgets in an application.
    
        This class is designed to interface with the application's property window, registering various schemes and their corresponding delegates to handle different types of property widgets. It manages the lifecycle of these widgets by providing methods for their registration on startup and unregistration on shutdown. The class ensures that property widgets for geometry, materials, paths, shaders, physics, and animation graphs are made available within the application's user interface, allowing users to interact with different aspects of a scene or object properties.
