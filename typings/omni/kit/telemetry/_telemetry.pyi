        Sends a generic structured log event with caller specified data.
        
         @param[in] eventType    A string describing the event that occurred.  There is no
                                 restriction on the content or formatting of this value.
                                 This should neither be ``nullptr`` nor an empty string.
         @param[in] duration     A generic duration value that can be optionally included
                                 with the event.  It is the caller's respsonsibility to
                                 decide on the usage and semantics of this value depending
                                 on the @p eventType value.  This may be 0.0 if no duration
                                 value is needed for the event.
         @param[in] data1        A string data value to be sent with the event.  The contents
                                 and interpretation of this string depend on the @p eventTyoe
                                 value.
         @param[in] data2        A string data value to be sent with the event.  The contents
                                 and interpretation of this string depend on the @p eventTyoe
                                 value.
         @param[in] value1       A floating point value to be sent with the event.  This value
                                 will be interpreted according to the @p eventType value.
         @param[in] value2       A floating point value to be sent with the event.  This value
                                 will be interpreted according to the @p eventType value.
        
         @returns No return value.
        
         @remarks This sends a generic event to the structured logging log file.  The contents,
                  semantics, and interpretation of this event are left entirely up to the caller.
                  This will be a no-op if telemetry is disabled (ie: the telemetry module either
                  intentionally was not loaded or failed to load).
