        The delegate that keeps multiple delegates and pick them depending on the
        routing conditions.
    
        It's possible to add the routing conditions with `add_route`, and
        conditions could be a type or a lambda expression.
    
        The latest added routing is stronger than previously added. Routing added
        without conditions is the default.
    
        We use type routing to make the specific kind of nodes unique, and also
        we can use the lambda function to make the particular state of nodes
        unique (ex. full/collapsed).
    
        It's possible to use type and lambda routing at the same time.
    
        Usage examples:
    
           delegate.add_route(TextureDelegate(), type="Texture2d")
           delegate.add_route(CollapsedDelegate(), expressipon=is_collapsed)
