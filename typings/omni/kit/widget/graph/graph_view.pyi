                Rebuild all the nodes and connections in the next update cycle. It's
                delayed because it's possible that it's called multiple times a
                frame. And we need to create all the widgets only one.
        
                The challenge here is the ability of USD making input-to-input and output-to-output connections. In USD it's
                perfectly fine to have the following network:
        
                A.out --> B.out
                A.in  <-- B.in
        
                So it doesn't matter if the port is input or output. To draw such connections properly and to know which side
                of the node it should connect, we need to find out the direction of the flow in this node network. This is the
                overview of the algorithm to trace the nodes and compute the direction of the flow.
        
                STEP 1. Create the cache of the model and indices to be able to access the cache fast.
        
                STEP 2. Scan all the nodes and find roots. A root is a node that doesn't have an output connected to another
                node.
        
                STEP 3. Trace connections of roots and assign them level. Level is the distance of the node from the root.
                The root has level 0. The nodes connected to root has level one. The next connected nodes have level 2 etc.
                We assume that level is the flow direction. The flow goes from nodes to root.
        
                STEP 4. It's easy to check if the connection goes to the direction opposite to flow. Such connections have
                virtual ports.
