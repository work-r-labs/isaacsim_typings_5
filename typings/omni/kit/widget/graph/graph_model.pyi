class GraphModel:
    """
    The base class for the Graph model.
    
        The model is the central component of the graph widget. It is the
        application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface,
        and it directly manages the data. It follows closely model–view pattern.
        It defines the standard interface to be able to interoperate with the
        components of the model-view architecture. It is not supposed to be
        instantiated directly. Instead, the user should subclass it to create a
        new model.
    
        The model manages two kinds of data elements. Node and port are the
        atomic data elements of the model. Both node and port can have any number
        of sub-ports and any number of input and output connections.
    
        There is no specific Python type for the elements of the model. Since
        Python has dynamic types, the model can return any object as a node or a
        port. When the widget needs to get a property of the node, it provides
        the given node back to the model.
    
        Example:
    
        .. code:: python
    
           class UsdShadeModel(GraphModel):
               @property
               def nodes(self, prim=None):
                   # Return Usd.Prim in a list

               @property
               def name(self, item=None):
                   # item here is Usd.Prim because UsdShadeModel.nodes returns
                   # Usd.Prim
                   return item.GetPath().name
    
           # Accessing nodes and properties example
           model = UsdShadeModel()
    
           # UsdShadeModel decides the type of nodes. It's a list with Usd.Prim
           nodes = model.nodes
    
           for node in nodes:
               # The node is accessed through evaluation of self[key]. It will
               # return the proxy object that redirects its properties back to
               # model. So the following line will call UsdShadeModel.name(node).
