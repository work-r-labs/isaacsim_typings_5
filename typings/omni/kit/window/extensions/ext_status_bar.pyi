    A custom status bar extension for the Omniverse application.
    
        This class creates a status bar that listens to specific events in the Omniverse application and updates its display message and color accordingly. It subscribes to events related to the syncing of the registry and the installation of extensions, and it displays success or failure messages with corresponding colors based on the event outcomes.
