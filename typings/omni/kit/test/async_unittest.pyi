"""
Async version of python unittest module.

AsyncTestCase, AsyncTestSuite and AsyncTextTestRunner classes were copied from python unittest source and async/await
keywords were added.

There are two ways of registering tests, which must all be in the 'tests' submodule of your python module.

    1. 'from X import *" from every file containing tests
    2. Add the line 'scan_for_test_modules = True' in your __init__.py file to pick up tests in every file starting
       with 'test_'
