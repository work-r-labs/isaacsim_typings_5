        In practice that function just waits couple of frames, but semantically it is different from other wait function.
        It is used when we want to wait because it would look like normal person interaction. E.g. instead of moving mouse
        and clicking with speed of light wait a bit.
    
        This is also a place where delay can be increased with a setting to debug UI tests.
