    A class that handles the registration, use, and cleanup of a hotkey for toggling snappable manipulators.
    
        This class provides functionality to register a hotkey that toggles snapping for manipulators in a viewport. It supports fallback registration if the hotkey core extension is not available and ensures that resources are cleaned up appropriately.
