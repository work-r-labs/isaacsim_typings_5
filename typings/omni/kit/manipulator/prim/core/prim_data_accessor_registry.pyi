    A registry for managing data accessors within the application.
    
        This class serves as a central hub to register and unregister data accessors, which are functions responsible for manipulating and accessing data associated with specific tags. It provides methods to add and remove data accessors, retrieve the current list of registered data accessors, and manage an event stream to notify about changes in data accessor registration.
    
        The class maintains an internal dictionary to map data tags to their corresponding data accessor functions. It also holds an event stream object to emit events when data accessors are added or removed.
