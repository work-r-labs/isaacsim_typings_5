    A class designed to extend Omniverse Kit's menu capabilities, specifically for creating various types of primitives.
    
        This class manages the creation and organization of menu items related to creating different types of primitives, such as shapes, lights, audio sources, cameras, and more. It dynamically builds a 'Create' menu based on settings and available options, allowing users to quickly access tools for adding new elements into their scene. The class also handles custom actions for creating these items with specific attributes or settings.
