        This module contains bindings to the C++ omni::audio::IAudioDeviceEnum
        interface.  This provides functionality for enumerating available audio
        devices and collecting some basic information on each one.

        Sound devices attached to the system may change at any point due to user
        activity (ie: connecting or unplugging a USB audio device).  When enumerating
        devices, it is important to collect all device information directly instead
        of caching it.

        The device information is suitable to be used to display to a user in a menu
        to allow them to choose a device to use by name.

            This interface contains functions for audio device enumeration.  This is able to
            enumerate all audio devices attached to the system at any given point and collect the
            information for each device.  This is only intended to collect the device information
            needed to display to the user for device selection purposes.  If a device is to be
            chosen based on certain needs (ie: channel count, frame rate, etc), it should be done

                is the maximum number of channels that the device can natively handle without

                (ie: 7.1 to stereo) will often result in multiple channels being blended

                Check if the audio device backend uses direct hardware access.
        
                A direct hardware audio backend is capable of exclusively locking audio
                devices, so devices are not guaranteed to open successfully and opening
                devices to test their format may be disruptive to the system.
        
                ALSA is the only 'direct hardware' backend that's currently supported.
                Some devices under ALSA will exclusively lock the audio device; these
                may fail to open because they're busy.
                Additionally, some devices under ALSA can fail to open because they're
                misconfigured (Ubuntu's default ALSA configuration can contain
                misconfigured devices).
                In addition to this, opening some devices under ALSA can take a
                substantial amount of time (over 100ms).
                For these reasons, it is important to verify that you are not using a
