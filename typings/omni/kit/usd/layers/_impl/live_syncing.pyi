        Live Syncing includes the interfaces to management Live Sessions of all layers in the bound UsdContext.
        A Live Session is a concept that extends non-destructive live workflow for USD layers so all connectors
        can join the session to co-work together.
    
        Each Live Session is bound to an USD file with unique URL to be identified. And it has only unique instance
        in the same UsdContext for each layer, which means the Live Sessions can be joined multiple times.
        User can only join the Live Sessions that belong to the used layers in the bound UsdContext, either those layers
        are added as sublayers or references/payloads. If a layer is added as both a local sublayer or reference/payload,
        the sublayer and reference/payload cannot join the same Live Session at the same time. However, a Live Session
        can be joined multiple times if the corresponding layer is added as multiple references/payloads.
    
        Thread Safety: All interfaces of LiveSyncing are not thread-safe. And It's recommended to call
