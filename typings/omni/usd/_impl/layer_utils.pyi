        Layer lock is a customized concept in Kit that's not from USD. It's used to complement the concept
        of file permission. Unlike the writable permission on file system, lock is bound
        to stage. So a layer may be locked in this stage, but not for other stages. Lock status
        is persistent across sessions, and saved as a flag inside the custom data of root layer.
